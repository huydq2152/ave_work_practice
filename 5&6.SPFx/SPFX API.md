# Assignment
Design a list for each component/webpart and integrate component/webpart with list using PNP/JS

1. The list/library title is configurable for component/webpart, so you can specify which list/library component/webpart read data from.

2. Choose a list or library as backend storage to store data.

3. Select appropriate columns to store metadata.

4. You should consider how the component/webpart displays when there are lots of items

5. Commit your code to your SPFx branch every day. **DO NOT** submit all code at the end.
